# Summary

A neighbor of mine said that this particular bracket wasn't available anymore for their RV.  Its a Leisure Travel Free Spirit 210B Sprinter.  
I was able to use their broken bracket to get the correct sizing and functionality.   I also designed it so that it would be stronger than the original while still having the same critical dimensions.  This may work for other sliding drawers and you are welcome to change the original Fusion 360 file 
https://a360.co/2HBxbWG is a short version
https://a360.co/2HvQ4tV is a tall version

Print with the screw holes on the bottom

The inside has ribs to ensure a tight fit.

Notes: 
The most important part is to make sure the base has sufficient layers.   The more infill you give it the longer it should last.   
I just listed the materials I used, but feel free to use ABS or PETG or even Nylon.  

Print with screw holes on the print bed.
